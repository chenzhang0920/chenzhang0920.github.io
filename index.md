I am a PhD student in the [III-V Device Group](https://personal.hkust-gz.edu.cn/renjiewang/#/offline/rlKIqrQFaY3?cps=hide&rps=hide&nav=0&ha=0&la=0&fc=0&out=0&rt=0) at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guang Zhou), supervised by [Prof. Renjie WANG](https://facultyprofiles.hkust-gz.edu.cn/faculty-personal-page?id=256), and funded by the HKUST(GZ) Postgraduate Studentship.

Prior to HKUST(GZ), I have worked on fluid mechanics, mesh generation, and machine learning under the guidance of [Prof. Penghao DUAN](https://scholars.cityu.edu.hk/en/persons/pengduan). Besides, I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Engineering from [BUCT](https://www.buct.edu.cn/main.htm) and a Master's degree in Engineering from [SZU](https://www.szu.edu.cn/). During my Master's degree, I conducted research at [SZTU](https://www.sztu.edu.cn/) as a joint trainee..

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me at — **chenzhang0920 [at] qq.com**
